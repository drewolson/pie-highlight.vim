# `vim` highlighting for `pie`

A little bit of comfort highlighting when working through https://github.com/the-little-typer/pie

Install it using `Plug`:

```sh
Plug 'felipesere/pie-highlight.vim'
```

The highlighting is pretty rudimentary, and the indentation is based on `lisp`.


PRs are welcome :smile:
